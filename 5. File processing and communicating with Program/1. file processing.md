SQlite
    -- is actually a C library which allows the user to read and write data directly to file.
    -- the complete SQLite database is stored only in a single file
    -- doesn't require separate server process to be running
    -- also supports transactions, which are a set of database operations that must be executed in full, or rolled back if one of them fails
    -- The standard Python library has a module called sqlite3, providing an interface compliant with the DB-API 2.0 specification described by PEP 249.
    -- The purpose of the DB-API 2.0 specification is to define a common standard for creating modules to work with databases in Python.
    -- import sqlite3


connect('hello.db')
    -- creates and retuns database connection to 'hello.db'
    -- creates a database file if not exists

connect(:memory)
    -- creates database in RAM
