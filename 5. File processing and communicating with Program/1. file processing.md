SQlite
    -- is actually a C library which allows the user to read and write data directly to file.
    -- the complete SQLite database is stored only in a single file
    -- doesn't require separate server process to be running
    -- also supports transactions, which are a set of database operations that must be executed in full, or rolled back if one of them fails
    -- The standard Python library has a module called sqlite3, providing an interface compliant with the DB-API 2.0 specification described by PEP 249.
    -- The purpose of the DB-API 2.0 specification is to define a common standard for creating modules to work with databases in Python.
    -- import sqlite3


connect('hello.db')
    -- creates the database connection to 'hello.db' and returns connection object
    -- creates a database file if not exists

connect(:memory)
    -- creates database in RAM

conn.cursor()
    -- the method creates cursor object that allows any SQL statements to be executed in the database.

cur.execute(stmt)
    -- to execute the sql query stored in variable stmt
    -- has an optional arguments in the form of array parameters
        -- e.g.
            c.execute('INSERT INTO tasks (name, priority) VALUES (?,?)', ('My first task', 1))

conn.commit()
    -- commits the changes to database

conn.close()
    -- closes the databases connection

cur.executemany()
    -- method allows you to insert multiple records at once. As an argument, it accepts an SQL statement and an array containing any number of tuples
    -- e.g.
        tasks = [
            ('My first task', 1),
            ('My second task', 5),
            ('My third task', 10),
        ]
        c.executemany('INSERT INTO tasks (name, priority) VALUES (?,?)', tasks)
        conn.commit()
