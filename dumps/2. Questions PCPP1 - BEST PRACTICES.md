       writing
       and should be followed at all times.
    1. PEP 8 is constantly evolving, which means its recommendations are constantly changing; therefore, it's not worth
       adopting a code writing standard that is not well-established or solid.
    1. If you are resuming work on a project that has not been following PEP 8 guidelines, it is recommended that you
       rewrite the existing code to make it PEP 8 compliant.
    1. You can ignore some specific PEP 8 guidelines if following them will mean that you break backwards compatibility
       or
       degrade code readability.
    1. It is recommended that you follow PEP 8 guidelines if you are starting a new Python project.

1. 👉**Which of the following statements is consistent with the Zen of Python philosophy with regard to namespaces (
   Select
   the best answer.)**
    1. You should generally avoid using many namespaces in your code as this approach will help you avoid conflicts with
       already existing names across different scopes.
    1. The Python namespace mechanism does not let you manage the availability if identifiers across different scopes
       and is considered bad practice.
    1. You should use global variables as they help you make your code more sustainable, reusable, and readable.
    1. You should generally avoid using the global keyword to modify a variable inside a function, because it can result
       in name collisions in your code.

    1. PEP 8 recommends that your imports be on separate lines.

    1. You should avoid using wildcard imports (e.g. from vehicles import * ).
    1. You should avoid using absolute imports (i.e. imports that use absolute paths separated by full stops).
