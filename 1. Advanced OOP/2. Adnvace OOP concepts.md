Python core syntax covers:

    operators like '+', '-', '*', '/', '%' and many others;
    operators like '==', '<', '>', '<=', 'in' and many others;
    indexing, slicing, subscripting;
    built-in functions like str(), len()
    reflexion – isinstance(), issubclass()
and a few more elements.

magic methods/special purpose methoda/dunder methods
e.g     + = __add__()
        len() = __len__()

        number + 20 is equivalent to number.__add__(20)

Inheritance & polymorphism

Extended funcation arguments
    *args, **kwargs
    when forwarding, should be forwarded with * like below:

    to another handy and smart function, you should do that in the following way:

def combiner(a, b, *args, **kwargs):
    super_combiner(*args, **kwargs)

def super_combiner(*my_args, **my_kwargs):
    print('my_args:', my_args)
    print('my_kwargs', my_kwargs)

combiner(10, '20', 40, 60, 30, argument1=50, argument2='66')

OutPut:
    my_args: (40, 60, 30)
    my_kwargs {'argument1': 50, 'argument2': '66'}



Decorators::
    Decorators are used in:
        the validation of arguments;
        the modification of arguments;
        the modification of returned objects;
        the measurement of execution time;
        message logging;
        thread synchronization;
        code refactorization;
        caching.

Decorating functions with classes:
    class should have __call__ method

without argument
    the __init__ method assigns a decorated function reference to the self.attribute for later use;
    the __call__ method, which is responsible for supporting a case when an object is called, calls a previously referenced function.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    class SimpleDecorator:
        def __init__(self, own_function):
            self.func = own_function

        def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            print('"{}" was called with the following arguments'.format(self.func.__name__))
            print('\t{}\n\t{}\n'.format(args, kwargs))
            self.func(*args, **kwargs)
            print('Decorator is still operating')

    @SimpleDecorator
    def combiner(*args, **kwargs):
        print("\tHello from the decorated function; received arguments:", args, kwargs)

    combiner('a', 'b', exec='yes')
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

wit argument
    the reference to function to be decorated is passed to __call__ method which is called only once during decoration process,
the decorator arguments are passed to __init__ method
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    class WarehouseDecorator:
        def __init__(self, material):
            self.material = material

        def __call__(self, own_function):
            def internal_wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
                print('<strong>*</strong> Wrapping items from {} with {}'.format(own_function.__name__, self.material))
                own_function(*args, **kwargs)
                print()
            return internal_wrapper

    @WarehouseDecorator('kraft')
    def pack_books(*args):
        print("We'll pack books:", args)

    @WarehouseDecorator('foil')
    def pack_toys(*args):
        print("We'll pack toys:", args)

    pack_books('Alice in Wonderland', 'Winnie the Pooh')
    pack_toys('doll', 'car')
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Class decorators:
    Like function decorators, the new (decorated) class is available under the name 'MyClass' and is used to create an instance. The original class named 'MyClass' is no longer available in your name space. The callable object returned by the class decorator creates and returns a new instance of the original class, extended in some way.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    @my_decorator
    class MyClass:

    obj = MyClass()

    eq to :
    def my_decorator(A):
        ...

    class MyClass:
        ...

    MyClass = my_decorator(MyClass())

    obj = MyClass()
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Example of the class decorator to monitor the fact that some code gets access to the class object attributes
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    def object_counter(class_):
        class_.__getattr__orig = class_.__getattribute__

        def new_getattr(self, name):
            if name == 'mileage':
                print('We noticed that the mileage attribute was read')
            return class_.__getattr__orig(self, name)

        class_.__getattribute__ = new_getattr
        return class_

    @object_counter
    class Car:
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Decorators rely heavily on closures and *args and **kwargs.

Interesting note:
    the idea of decorators was described in two documents – PEP 318 and PEP 3129. Don't be discouraged that the first PEP was prepared for Python 2, because what matters here is the idea, not the implementation in a specific Python.

Different Faces of python methods:
Instance methods    -- methods that require instance of class to be called, definition contains first parameter as class instance(conventionally 'self')
Class methods       
    -- bound to the class not to objects, work on class itselfs.
    -- Convention :
        -- @classdecorator is used preceding the class method definition
        -- First parameter is 'cls'(this name is conventional, i.e. anyother name can be used), used to refer class methods and class variables

Static methods
    -- Do not require/expect a parametere indicating the class objects or class itslef
    -- Convention :
        -- @staticmethod is used preceding the static method definition
        -- Do not have ability to modify the state of objects or classes (because the lack the parameter that would allow this)

Using static and class methods - comparison
    a class method requires 'cls' as the first parameter and a static method does not;
    a class method has the ability to access the state or methods of the class, and a static method does not;
    a class method is decorated by '@classmethod' and a static method by '@staticmethod';
    a class method can be used as an alternative way to create objects, and a static method is only a utility method.


Abstract classes:
    A class which contains one or more abstract methods is called an abstract class. This means that abstract classes are not limited to containing only abstract methods – some of the methods can already be defined, but if any of the methods is an abstract one, then the class becomes abstract.

    A abstract method is a method that has a declaration, but does not have a implementation.

helper class = Abstract Base Classes(ABC)
module = abc



Encapsulation:
    built-in function property()
    decorator @property

    -- getter @property
    -- setter @level.setter (where level is the name of the attribute)
    -- deleter @level.deleter


inheritance vs composition:
    inheritance - 'is a'
    composition - 'has a'

Advanced exception handling:
    -- In Python, implicit chaining and explicit chaining are two mechanisms for linking exceptions together when handling errors. These mechanisms provide additional context about what went wrong by maintaining a connection between exceptions that occur during error handling
    -- Implicit Chaining
        -- Occurs automatically when an exception is raised while handling another exception.
        -- Python maintains the connection by attaching the first exception (the "cause") to the new exception using the __context__ attribute.
        -- This type of chaining is built-in and does not require manual intervention.
            -- example:
                try:
                    1 / 0  # Raises ZeroDivisionError
                except ZeroDivisionError:
                    raise ValueError("Invalid operation")  # Automatically chained to the original exception
            -- Output:
                Traceback (most recent call last):
                    File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module>
                ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

                The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

                Traceback (most recent call last):
                    File "<stdin>", line 4, in <module>
                ValueError: Invalid operation
    -- Explicit Chaining
        -- Occurs when you explicitly chain exceptions using the from keyword.
        -- Allows you to specify a "cause" for the new exception, replacing the automatically chained exception (__context__).
        -- The __cause__ attribute is used to store the explicitly linked exception, making it clearer that the new exception is a direct result of the previous one.
            -- Example:
                try:
                    1 / 0  # Raises ZeroDivisionError
                except ZeroDivisionError as e:
                    raise ValueError("Invalid operation") from e  # Explicitly chaining exceptions
            -- Output
                Traceback (most recent call last):
                    File "<stdin>`", line 2, in <module>
                ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

                The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

                Traceback (most recent call last):
                    File "<stdin>", line 4, in <module>
                ValueError: Invalid operation
`



    Traceback object/method
    raise another exception with reference of already raised
        -- 
        try :
            a = 2/0
        except DivisionByZero as e:
            raise NewCustomException("Custom error message") from e

Shallow and deep Copy operations:
    id() function:
        -- returns identity of an object
        -- this is an integer which guaranteed to be unique and constant for this object during its lifetime
        -- two objects with non-overlapping lifetime may have same id() value
        -- CPython implementation details:
            -- This is the object in the memory.
            -- Don't treat it as an obsolute memory address
        -- if two variables referring to the same object, the return value of the id() function must be the same

    copy module
        copy.copy() -- shallow copy
        copy.deepcopy() -- deep copy

    shallow copy:
        -- creates a copy of only outer object, internal objects remains reference to original
        -- for e.g. if internal object is any collection object like list, and element of internal object is changed then original object also changes
        -- faster

    deep copy:
        -- creates a copy of outer as well as all internal objects
        -- constructs a new compound object and then, recursively, inserts copies into it of the objects found in the original
        -- changing internal objects does not changes the original object
        -- coparatively very slow

    difference between '==' and 'is' operators?
        '==' operator
            -- value is checked
            -- compares the values of both operands and checks value for equality
            -- two distinct objects with same value -- True
        'is' operator
            -- to check if both operands refer to the same object
            -- In simple words, it responds to the questio: "Are both variables referring to the same identity?"

    [:] array slice syntax creates an idependent copy of the list
        -- but internal list objects refers to the same address
            -- for e.g.
            a_list = [10, "banana", [997, 123]]
            b_list = a_list[:]
            b_list[2][0] = 112

                -- changes the value 997 to 112 in both a_list and b_list
                -- but output of a_list is b_ist is False
        -- hence slicing is shallow copy


Serialization of Python objects using pickle module:
    moduel pickle
        -- serilizing & deserializing should be done in same order
        -- serializing
            -- pickle.dump(a_dict, file_out) --excepts object to be persisted and a file handle.
            -- file to be opened in 'wb' i.e. write binary mode
            -- pickle.dumps(object_name) -- return byte object (storing in file or db is not happened, to be taken care by dev)
        -- deserializing
            -- data1 = pickle.load(file_in)
            -- file to be opened in 'rb' i.e. read binary mode
            -- pickle.loads() -- returns initail object
        -- PicklingError
            -- pickling non-pickleable objects
        -- RecursionError
            -- highly recursive data structure
        -- function, classes --only name gets pickled, definition (i.e. code/script and attributes) not pickled
    shelve module
        -- built on top of pickle
        -- implements a serialization dictionary where objects are pickled and associated with a key
        -- The keys must be ordinary strings, because the underlying database (dbm) requires strings.
        -- e.g.
            import shelve

            shelve_name = 'first_shelve.shlv'

            my_shelve = shelve.open(shelve_name, flag='c')
            my_shelve['EUR'] = {'code':'Euro', 'symbol': '€'}
            my_shelve['GBP'] = {'code':'Pounds sterling', 'symbol': '£'}
            my_shelve['USD'] = {'code':'US dollar', 'symbol': '$'}
            my_shelve['JPY'] = {'code':'Japanese yen', 'symbol': '¥'}
            my_shelve.close()

            new_shelve = shelve.open(shelve_name)
            print(new_shelve['USD'])
            new_shelve.close()

        -- meaning of the optional flag parameter:
            Value	Meaning
            'r'	Open existing database for reading only
            'w'	Open existing database for reading and writing
            'c'	Open database for reading and writing, creating it if it doesn’t exist (this is a default value)
            'n'	Always create a new, empty database, open for reading and writing
        -- few additional notes:
            -- the keys must be strings
            -- Python puts the changes in a buffer which is periodically flushed to the disk. To enforce an immediate flush, call the sync() method on your shelve object
            -- when you call the close() method on an shelve object, it also flushes the buffers

Metaprogramming:
    -- A metaclass is subclass of type class in python
    -- type is superclass of all classes and objects in python
    -- type(MyClass), type(int), type(list) is 'type'
    -- my_instance = MyClass(), type(my_instance) = '__main__.MyClass'
    -- some special attributes:
        --  __name__ – inherent for classes; contains the name of the class;
        -- __class__ – inherent for both classes and instances; contains information about the class to which a class instance belongs;
        -- __bases__ – inherent for classes; it’s a tuple and contains information about the base classes of a class;
        -- __dict__ – inherent for both classes and instances; contains a dictionary (or other type mapping object) of the object's attributes.
    -- When the type() function is called with three arguments, then it dynamically creates a new class,"type(, , )"
        -- first argument specifies the class name; this value becomes the __name__ attribute of the class
        -- second argument specifies a tuple of the base classes from which the newly created class is inherited; this argument becomes the __bases__ attribute of the class
        -- thrid argument specifies a dictionary containing method definitions and variables for the class body; the elements of this argument become the __dict__ attribute of the class and state the class namespace.
    --  when type(, , ) is called, __call__ is called
        -- this method calls two other methods
            __new__()
                -- responsible for creating class instance in computer memory
                -- runs before __inti__()
            __init__()
                -- responsible for object initialization

{'__module__': '__main__', '__dict__': <attribute '__dict__' of 'My_Object' objects>, '__weakref__': <attribute '__weakref__' of 'My_Object' objects>, '__doc__': None, 'custom_attribute': 'Added by My_Meta'}
