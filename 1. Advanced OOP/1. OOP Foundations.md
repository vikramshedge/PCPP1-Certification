An instance is one particular physical instantiation of a class that occupies memory and has data elements.
This is what 'self' refers to when we deal with class instances.

Attribute:
    Variables
    Methods -- (also called as Callable attribute)

Class attributes are most often addressed with 'dot' notation, i.e., <class>dot<attribute>.
The other way to access attributes (variables) it to use the getattr() and setattr() functions.

type:
     foremost type that any class can be inherited from;
     type of class, then type is returned;

type() --returns new type objecrt when called,
        three arguments -- to be discussed in metaclass section

__class__:
    returns the information about the class
    for a class : <class 'type'>
    for an instance : <class '__main__.Duck'>
    for an variable : <class 'str'>
    for an method : <class 'method'>
    for an function : <class 'function'>


instance variables:
    defined in __init__ method of a class
    present in __dict__ of an instance/object of a class
    not present in Class __dict__

class variables:
    defined in class definition
    present in __dict__ of an class of a class
    not present in instance of __dict__
    available before any of the instances are created
    can be used by any of the instance variable
