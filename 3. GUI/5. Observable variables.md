-- you can only create an observable variable after the main window initialization
-- observable variables are typed

There are four kinds (types) of observable variable used by tkinter:
    -- BooleanVar default False
    -- DoubleVar default 0.0
    -- IntVar default 0
    -- StringVar default ""

    -- use method set() to assign the value -- argument should type compatible
    -- use method get() to use the value

    Observer
        -- is a function (a kind of callback) which will be invoked automatically each time a specified event occurs in the variable’s life
        -- Each observable variable can be enriched with a number of observers
        -- The number of observers is not limited
        -- trace()
            -- Adding an observer to a variable is done by a method named trace():
                obsid = variable.trace(trace_mode, observer)
            -- The method takes two arguments:
                --  trace_mode
                    -- a string describing which events should trigger an observer – the possible values are:
                        -- "r" – if you want to be aware of the variable reads (accessing its value through get())
                        -- "w" – if you want to be aware of the variable writes (changing its value through set())
                        -- "u" – if you want to be aware of the variable’s annihilation (removing the object through del)
                -- observer
                    --  reference to a function which will be invoked when the specified event occurs
            -- this function returns a string which is a unique observer identifier

        -- should be declared as a three-parameter function
            def observer(id, ix, act):
            :
            :
        -- id – an internal observable variable identifier (unusable for us);
        -- ix – an empty string (always – don’t ask us why, it’s tkinter’s business)
        -- act – a string informing us what happened to the variable or, in other words, what reason triggered the observer ('r', 'w' or 'u')
        -- if you don’t need any of the arguments, you can declare the observer as: def obs(*):
        -- Removing the observer is done with a method named trace_vdelete():
            -- variable.trace_vdelete(trace_mode,obsid)
                -- trace_mode – the mode in which the observer has been created;
                -- obsid – the observer’s identifier obtained from the previous trace() invocation.
