after()
    --  this method expects two arguments: the first is a time interval specification (expressed in milliseconds: 1 s = 1000 ms) and the second points to an existing function; successful invocation of the method causes the event manager to change its plans; when the number of milliseconds elapses, the manager will invoke the function (only once); note: this the only possible way of controlling the passage of time when using an event-driven environment.

    --  Why? Because you can’t just invoke the built-in sleep() function within any of your callbacks – it would freeze your application for the whole nap time; the after() method returns a value which is as specific as the method itself – it’s a unique id of the planned invocation; is it usable? Yes, it is, e.g., when you are going to delete the previously planned invocation from the manager’s calendar, which is done with a method named…

after_cancel(id)
    --  the method cancels the planned invocation identified by the id argument.

destroy()
    -- widget method to remove the widget completely, even from event manager's memory
    -- removes widget and its children, recursively

focus
    -- focus_get()
        -- returns a reference to the currently focused widget, or None when no widget owns the focus (note: you can invoke the method from any widget, including the main window)
    -- focus_set()
        -- focuses the widget from the method which was invoked
