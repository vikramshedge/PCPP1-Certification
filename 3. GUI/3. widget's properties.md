Using dictionary
    old_val = Widget["prop"] -- get
    Widget["prop"] = new_val -- set

    old_val = Widget.cget("prop") -- get
    Widget.config(prop=new_val) -- set

Tkinter represents fonts as tuples
Any font can be described as two- or three-element tuples:
    ("font_family_name", "font_size")
    ("font_family_name", "font_size", "font_style")
    -- second tuple element i.e. "font-size" has to be string
    
List of wedget sizes:
Widget property name	Property role
borderwidth	The width of the 3D-frame surrounding some widgets (e.g., Button)
highlightthickness	The width of the additional frame drawn around the widget when it gains the focus
padx/pady	The width/height of an additional empty space/margin around the widget
wraplength	If the text filling the widget becomes longer than this property’s value, it will be wrapped (possibly more than once)
height	The height of the widget
underline	The index of the character inside the widget’s text, which should be presented as underlined or -1 otherwise (the underlined letter/digit can be used as a shortcut key, but it needs a specialized callback to work – no automation here
width	The width of the widget

anchor
    The anchor is an imaginary (invisible) point inside the widget to which the text (if any) is anchored. 
    Widgets tend to put their text in the middle of themselves (both in horizontal and vertical directions).
    The location of the anchor can easily be changed, as there is a property of the same name
    -- nine values
        --  nw  n       ne
            w   center  e
            sw  s       se
        -- center is default


cursor
    -- specify this property to change the shape for the mouse cursor
    -- default is arrow
    -- every widget can have different cursor shape
    -- cursor shape changes when mouse is hovered over that widget
