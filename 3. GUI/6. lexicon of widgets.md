some more properties and methods:
Button:
    properties:
    command
        -- the callback being invoked when the button is clicked
    justify
        -- the way in which the inner text is justified: possible (self-describing) values are: LEFT, CENTER, and RIGHT
    state
        -- if you set the property to DISABLED, the button becomes deaf and doesn’t react to clicks, while its title is shown in gray; setting it to NORMAL restores normal button functioning; when the mouse is located above the button, the property changes its value to ACTIVE

    methods:
    flash()
        -- the button flashes a few times but doesn’t change its state
    invoke()
        -- activates the callback assigned to the widget and returns the same value the callback returned; note: this is the only way to invoke your own callback explicitly, as the event manager must be aware of the fact

Checkbox:
    properties:
    bd
        -- the checkbutton frame width (default is two pixels)
    command
        -- the callback being invoked when the checkbutton changes its state
    justify
        -- the same as for Button
    state
        -- the same as for Button
    variable
        -- an observable IntVar variable reflecting the widget’s state; defaultly it’s set to 1 when the checkbutton is checked, and to 0 otherwise
    offvalue
        -- the non-default value being assigned to a variable when the checkbutton is not checked
    onvalue
        -- the non-default value being assigned to a variable when the checkbutton is checked

    methods:
    deselect()
        -- unchecks the widget
    flash()
        -- the same as for Button
    invoke()
        -- the same as for Button
    select()
        -- checks the widget
    toggle()
        -- toggles the widget (changes its state to the opposite one)

RadioButton:
    Properties:
    command
        -- the callback being invoked when the Radiobutton (not the group it belongs to!) changes its state
    justify
        -- the same as for Button
    state
        -- the same as for Button
    variable
        -- an observable IntVar or StringVar variable reflecting the current selection within the Radiobutton’s group; changing the variable’s value automatically changes the selection
    value
        -- a unique (inside the group) value identifying the Radiobutton; can be an integer value or a string, and should be compatible with the variable’s type

    methods:
    deselect()
        -- unchecks the widget
    flash()
        -- the same as for Button
    invoke()
        -- the same as for Button
    select()
        -- checks the widget

    Note: there is no toggle() method as a single Radiobutton performs such an operation

Label:
    Properties:
    text
        -- a string which will be shown within the Label; note: newline characters (\n) are interpreted in the usual way
    textvariable
        -- the same as for text, but makes use of an observable StringVar variable, so if you change the variable’s alteration, it will be immediately visible on the screen

Message:
    -- very similar to the Label (among other things, it has the same properties) but is able to format the presented text by fitting it automatically to the widget’s size

Frame:
    -- This widget is, in fact, a container designed to store other widgets.
    -- can be used to separate a rectangular part of the window and to treat it as a kind of local window. Such a window works as a master widget for all the widgets embedded within it.
    -- has its own coordinate system, so when you place a widget inside a Frame, you measure its location relative to the Frame’s upper-left corner, not the window’s one.
    -- if you move the Frame to a new position, all its inner widgets will go with it.
    -- can grasp virtually any widget – including another Frame.
    -- Properties:
    takefocus
        -- normally, the Frame doesn’t take the focus (which would seem to be obvious) but if you really want it to behave in this way, you can set the property to 1

LabelFrame:
    -- widget is a Frame enriched with a visible border and a title (also visible). The title may be located at one of 12 possible places on the border line
    -- Properties:
    takefocus
        -- the same as for the Frame
    text
        -- the LabelFrame’s title
    labelanchor
        -- the title’s location, defined as a string containing a quasi-compass coordinate
            NW  N   NE
        WN              EN
        W               E
        WS              ES
            SW  S   SE

Entry:
    -- text input
    -- properties:
    command
        -- although Entry is obviously a clickable widget, it doesn’t allow you to bind a callback through the command property. You can observe and control all occurring changes instead by setting the tracer function for the observable variable which cooperates with Entry
    show
        -- a string assigned to this property will be displayed instead of the actual characters entered into the input field; e.g., if you set show='*', this will enable the widget to safely edit the user’s password
    state
        -- the same as for Button
    textvariable
        -- an observable StringVar reflecting the current state of the input field
    width
        -- the input field’s width (in characters)

    Methods:
    get()
        -- returns the current input field’s contents as a string
    set(s)
        -- sets the whole input field’s contents with the s string
    delete(first, last=None)
        -- deletes a part of the input field’s contents; first and last can be integers with values indexing the string; if the last argument is omitted, a single character is deleted; if last is specified as END, it points to the place after the last field’s character
    insert(index, s)
        -- inserts the s string at the field position pointed to by index

Menu:
    -- tk.Menu(container)
        -- creates menu item into the specified container
        -- below code creats first menu item which can be referenced by main_menu object variable and adds it to the menu of the window(application)
            main_menu = tk.Menu(window)
            window.cofig(menu=main_menu)
        -- main_menu.add_cascade() -- adds menu with submenu list
        -- main_menu.add_command() -- adds menu as clickable, without the sublist (for e.g. about menu)
        -- underline=<int> property can be used to provide the Alt + key binding
        -- uniqueness in key binding is users responsibility
        -- tearoff = 0 is used to get rid of dashed line in sub-menu
        -- add_separator() -- add separating line after the current item or before the next item to be added
        -- accelerator="Ctrl-Q"
            -- (property) to be specified to use the hot-key,
            -- only adds the text to right of the menu name
            -- binding to be done manually

    modify/configure sub menu items:
        -- Note: you cannot modify any of the (sub)menu item by using the standard config() method invocation, because from tkinter's point of view, the item is not a widget – it’s only a very specific widget component.
        -- dedicated method named entryconfigure(). The method accepts two parameters:
            item.entryconfigure(i, prop=value)
                -- i, an integer index of the modified item (entry)
                -- prop=value, a keyworded argument pointing to the modified property
                    -- prop, name of the property of the sub-manue
                    -- value, value to be changed

    properties:
    postcommand
        -- a callback invoked every time a menu’s item is activated
    tearoff
        -- set to zero removes the tear-off decoration from the top of the cascade
    state
        -- when set to DISABLED, the menu item is grayed and inaccessible; setting it to ACTIVE restores its normal functionality
    accelerator
        -- a string describing a hot-key bound to the menu’s item
    
    Method:
    add_cascade(prop=val, ...)
        -- adds a cascade to the menu’s item
    add_command(prop=val, ...)
        -- assigns an action to the menu’s item
    add_separator()
        -- adds an separator line to the menu
    entryconfigure(i, prop=val,...)
        -- modifies the i-th menu item’s property named prop
