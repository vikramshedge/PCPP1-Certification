Canvas:
    properties:
    borderwidth
        -- canvas border’s width in pixels (default: 2)
    background (bg)
        -- canvas border’s color (default: the same as the underlying window’s color)
    height
        -- canvas height (in pixels)
    width
        -- canvas width (in pixels)

    canvas.create_line(x0, y0, x1, y1, ..., xn, yn, option...)
        -- create polygonal chain
        -- optoins:
            arrow
                -- normally, the chain ends aren’t marked in any special way, but you may want them to be finished with arrowheads; setting the arrow option to FIRST results in drawing an arrowhead at the chain’s beginning, LAST at the chain’s end, BOTH at both sides of the chain.
            fill
                -- chain color (setting the option to an empty string causes the line to be transparent)
            smooth
                -- setting it to True rounds the chain’s corners using a set of connected parabolas
            width
                -- line width (default: 1 pixel)
    -- create_rectangle(x0, y0, x1, y1, option...)
        -- creates rectangle
            -- outline
                -- rectangle edge color (if specified as an empty string, the edge is transparent)
            -- fill
                -- rectangle interior color
            -- width
                -- rectangle edge width in pixels (default: 1)
    -- create_polygon
        -- similar to method create_line
        -- no need to provide same point as the first and last, which is needed for create_line mehtod to draw polygon
    -- create_oval
        -- draws an eclipse inscribed in a ractangle with specified vertices
        -- if rectange is square then eclipse becomes circle
        -- same options as of create_polygon()
    -- create_arc(x0,y0,x1,y1,option...)
        --  draws the arc of an ellipse inscribed inside a rectangle with vertices at points (x0,y0) and (x1,y1)
        -- options:
            -- style
                -- can be set to one of the : PIESLICE (default), CHORD and ARC
            -- start
                -- the angle (in degrees) of the arc’s start relative to the X-axis (e.g., 90 means the highest point of the ellipse, while 0 is the right-most point. The default is 0)
            -- extent
                -- the arc’s span (in degrees) relative to the start point; note: the span is calculated counter-clockwise. The default is 90 (a quarter of an ellipse)
    -- create_text(x, y, option...)
        -- method puts text on the Canvas
        -- The text is placed inside a rectangle whose center is located at point (x,y)
        -- Options:
            -- fill
                -- text color
            -- font
                -- text font
            -- justify
                -- text justification: LEFT (default), CENTER, RIGHT
            -- text
                -- text to display (\n works as expected)
            -- width
                -- normally, the rectangle is as wide as the longest text line; using the width option forces the text to be aligned to that size
    -- create_image(x, y, option...)
        -- method draws an image (a bitmap) on the Canvas. The image is placed inside a rectangle whose center is located at point (x, y)
        -- optoins:
            -- image
                -- an object of the PhotoImage class containing the image itself; the PhotoImage class constructor needs a keyword argument named file pointing to a bitmap file (note: only GIF and PNG formats are accepted); the argument should specify the file’s path
        -- If you want to use a JPEG bitmap, some additional steps are required – you need to:
            -- import the Image and ImageTk classes from the PIL (Python Image Library) module;
            -- build an object of the Image() class and use its open() method to fetch the bitmap from the file (the argument should specify the file’s path)
            -- convert this object into a PhotoImage class object using an ImageTk function of the same name
            -- sample:
                import tkinter as tk
                import PIL

                window = tk.Tk()
                canvas = tk.Canvas(window, width=400, height=400, bg='red')
                jpg = PIL.Image.open('logo.jpg')
                image = PIL.ImageTk.PhotoImage(jpg)
                canvas.create_image(200, 200, image=image)
                button = tk.Button(window, text="Quit", command=window.destroy)
                canvas.grid(row=0)
                button.grid(row=1)
                window.mainloop()
