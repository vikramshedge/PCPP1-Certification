-- all events come to event manager, which is responsible for dispatching them to all the application components.
-- showinfo(), comes from messagebox module

-- we can also bing a callback to any of the events to widget(even non-clickable) by using method bind()
    -- widget.bind(event, callback)
-- bind_all() method binds callback to all currently existing widgets
-- unbind_all() is for reversing the bind_all()

Useful events
    Event name	Event role
    <Button-1>	Single left-click (if your mouse is configured for a right-handed user)
    <Button-2>	Single middle-click
    <Button-3>	Single right-click
    <ButtonRelease-1>	Left mouse button release Note: there are also events named <ButtonRelease-2> and <ButtonRelease-3>
    <DoubleButton-1>	Double left-click Note: there are also events named <DoubleButton-2> and <DoubleButton-3>
    Note again: the <Button-1> event is a part of <DoubleButton-1> too; if you assign a callback to <Button-1>, it will be launched, too!

    <Return>	The user presses the Enter/Return key
    <Key>	The user presses any key

event object:
    Property name	Property role
    widget	The widget’s object (not the widget’s name!) to which the event is addressed
    <x>/<y>	The mouse cursor’s coordinates at the moment of the event’s occurrence (both coordinates are counted relative to the target widget)
    <x_root>/<y_root>	As above, but relative to the screen
    <char>	The pressed key character code (only for keyboard events)
    <keysym>	The pressed key symbol (only for keyboard events)
    The full list of all recognized key symbols is presented here: https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TkCmd/keysyms.htm
    <keycode>	The pressed key numerical code (only for keyboard events)
    Don’t confuse this with char, which is the ASCII/UNICODE code of the character bound to the key
    <num>	The number of the clicked mouse button (only for mouse events)
    <type>	The event’s type


If you want to modify a property named prop, existing within a widget named wid, and you’re going set its value to val, you can use the config() method, just like here:
wid.config(prop=val)

This means that if you want to unbind your current callback from a Button named b1, you would use an invocation like this one:
b1.config(command=lambda:None)

This binds an empty (i.e., doing absolutely nothing) function to the widget’s callback.
