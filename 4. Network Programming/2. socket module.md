arguments for socket.shutdown()
socket.SHUT_RD - we aren't going to read the server's messages anymore (we declare ourselves deaf)
socket.SHUT_WR - we won't say a word (actually, we'll be dumb)
socket.SHUT_RDWR - specifies the conjunction of the two previous options.

In case of the non-existing/malformed address
The connect function throws an exception named socket.gaierror and its name comes from the name of a low-level function (usually provided not by Python but by the OS kernel) named getaddrinfo()

socket.timeout. This exception is raised when the server's reaction doesn't occur in a reasonable time
